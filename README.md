### Question 1
**Microscopic Image**:
As the parasite body is known to be a blob like structure of arbitrary shape which wil be a continuous region of black pixels, it will be most efficient to use ***Run-Length-Encoding (RLE)*** for the microscopic image. RLE encodes the image as the starting posiion of the pixel and its run-length. However, to **optimise** more in terms of space, we only encode black pixels as encoding both white and black pixels would take unnecessary space.
